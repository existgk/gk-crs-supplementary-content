  GAWAD KALASAG
  </h5>
  <p>
  Established in 1998, the Gawad KALASAG (GK) Search for Excellence in
  Disaster Risk Reduction and Management and Humanitarian Assistance has
  served as the country’s recognition and award scheme for various
  stakeholders who promote and implement disaster risk reduction and
  management, climate change adaptation (DRRM-CCA), and humanitarian
  assistance programs that protect and shield high risk communities
  against extreme hazards and render them more capable of addressing their
  vulnerabilities. It was aimed as a mechanism to obtain sustained
  commitment and support by recognizing the exceptional contributions of
  DRRM practitioners in strengthening the resilience and adaptive
  capacities of various aspects of society and communities to disaster
  risks. Based on past experiences and lessons learned, the Gawad KALASAG
  program was transformed into Gawad KALASAG Seal and Special Awards for
  Excellence in Disaster Risk Reduction and Management and Humanitarian
  Assistance (GK) and adopted a mandatory assessment of all Local
  Government Units, specifically Provinces, Cities, and Municipalities
  (PCM) and critical institutions (Schools and Hospitals); continued
  competition for Civil Society Organizations (CSOs); and special
  recognition for individuals and organizations. Commencing CY 2023, the
  GK will cover the (1) GK Seal for Local DRRM Councils and Offices; GK
  Special Awards for (2) Best Civil Society Organization, (3) Best
  People’s Organization, (4) Best Volunteer Organization; (5) Best Higher
  Education Institutions; (6) Best Private Organizations; (7) Best
  Government Emergency Management and Response Teams (GEMs); (8) Best
  Hospitals; (9) Best Schools; (10) GK Special Recognition for Individuals
  and Organizations; and (11) Heroic Act for Individuals and Groups. For
  more than 20 years in its implementation, the Gawad KALASAG, through its
  assessment guidelines, has evolved based on actual ground situations and
  experiences. The GK Seal for LDRRMCO is envisioned to serve as an
  assessment mechanism for all Local Government Units as they implement
  the mandatory provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act No.
  10121, specifically on the institutionalization of their Local DRRM
  Councils (LDRRMCs) and Local DRRM Offices (LDRRMOs), including other
  policy issuances such as the reporting on the allocation and utilization
  of the Local DRRM Fund (LDRRMF).

  Further, the transformation of the Gawad KALASAG Search into GK Seal
  will provide the platform for convergence and enhancement of the DRRM
  localization programs, projects, and strategies under the Office of
  Civil Defense, such as Review of Local DRRM Plans (LDRRMPs), the
  assessment of LDRRMCOs, assessment, and monitoring of LDRRMF
  Utilization. With the mandatory assessment, the challenges and gaps in
  the implementation of the LDRRM Plan of each LGU, and activities to
  address DRRM-CCA needs and priorities of LDRRM officers and staff, as
  well as LDRRMC members, can be identified.

  On the other hand, the assessment of other critical institutions
  (Schools, Hospitals, etc.) will further strengthen the
  institutionalization of the standards, thereby preventing disasters and
  minimizing disaster risks.

  Moreover, the GK Special Awards aims to annually recognize and
  acknowledge the outstanding contribution of partners and institutions
  such as Hospitals, Schools, Civil Society Organizations, People’s
  Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Private Organizations, GEMS, as
  well as groups and individuals. As the GK Seal and Special Awards seek
  to strengthen disaster resilience through a “whole-of-society” approach,
  it also ensures inclusivity, generating wider and greater participation,
  as well as equal opportunity for all stakeholders in the promotion and
  sustainability of DRR-CCA innovations and best practices.
